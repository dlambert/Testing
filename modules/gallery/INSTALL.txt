HELP

For more help, check out: http://drupal.galleryembedded.com

Requirements
------------
Gallery2.1 (or above) installed and working (see http://gallery.menalto.com)
Image Block module installed and activated in Gallery2
Image Frame module installed and activated in Gallery2
Drupal 5.x
Gallery module (this Drupal module)

Note that this module does not provide any photo/album functions itelf, but uses
Gallery2 (http://gallery.menalto.com) to provide this functionality.

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

1. Install Gallery 2.1 and Drupal 5.x (see their respective installation
   documents).  
   
   ***Warning*** - Do not name your Gallery2 directory "gallery", call it something else 
   (eg "gallery2"). Calling it "gallery" will cause a conflict with the Drupal gallery.module 
   as Drupal assumes that http://www.example.com/gallery refers to the Drupal module.

2. Ensure that "Image Block" and "Image Frame" modules are installed and activated in Gallery2.
   Check them in the non-embedded Gallery. See 
   http://codex.gallery2.org/index.php/Gallery2:Download for instructions to download it 
   if it was not included in your installation.

3. Log out of Gallery2 (non-embedded) - people have reported errors relating to sessions if this 
   is not done.

4. Copy the entire gallery module directory to your Drupal modules/ directory.

5. Enable the gallery module in Administer -> Site building -> Modules in your Drupal
   installation.

6. Go to Administer -> Site configuration -> Gallery and enter the URI of Gallery2. 
   Leave "autodetect" selected and click "Save configuration". A series of tests will run to check
   if everything is OK. There is a HELP link.

7. Enable the "Gallery Block" in Administer -> Site building -> Blocks, and optionally the 
   "Gallery Navigation" block and the "Gallery Grid Block".
   
8. Enable the "Access Gallery" permission for the roles that you want to be able to see the gallery
   and gallery blocks. Go to Administer -> User management -> Access control.
   
9. If necessary, disable the Register module in Gallery2 and remove the Login item from the sidebar
   block. All login and registration functions now need to go through Drupal (and from there
   automatically to Gallery2, not Gallery2 directly.)

Optional Steps
--------------
                       
 1. Sidebar.     Go to your Gallery2 site admin and include the blocks you want in the sidebar
                 (under Themes). I use "Item Actions" and "Album Quick Links (DHTML)". To use 
                 the latter you need to have installed the Album Select module.

 2. URL Rewrite. 
 
 3. g2image. If you install g2image http://g2image.steffensenfamily.com as either a standalone or
             TinyMCE plugin you will have an excellent image chooser for Drupal/Gallery2. The
             configuration is automatic when you hit the "Save configuration' button on the gallery
             settings page. See http://drupal.galleryembedded.com/index.php/G2Image for 
             installation instructions.
